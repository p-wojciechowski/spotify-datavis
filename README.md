# Spotify Visualization Shiny App

Visualization of streaming data from Spotify in the form of shiny R web app.
Data was requested from Spotify Account Settings to collect streaming information from 2020. For a deeper insight into artists, albums, genres, track features (*like danceability, energy, valence, etc.*), Spotify Web API was used to gather such metadata. Additionally, scraped data from Facebook was used to create graphs of mutual friends, visualizing relationship network in an interesting way.

Made together with [@krzyzinskim](https://github.com/krzyzinskim) and [@arturzolkowski](https://github.com/arturzolkowski).

Fully functional app deployed on:
